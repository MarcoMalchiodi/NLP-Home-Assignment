       "        '\\nFormer counterterrorism analyst Jonathan Schanzer joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the latest reports that the UNRWA allegedly was involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack. \\nIsrael has provided the Biden administration with a new dossier with information about how staffers for a United Nations agency assisted or supported the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7, Fox News has learned. \\nThe dossier specifically alleges that 12 employees who worked with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) aided in different capacities. According to the dossier, seven UN staffers crossed into Israel on Oct. 7 while other were accused of \"participating in a terror activity\" or coordinating vehicle movements.\\nThe dossier alleged that some 190 employees of UNRWA in Gaza had ties to Islamist terror groups; however, intelligence estimates provided to The Wall Street Journal put the number at approximately 1,200, or 10% of UNRWA\\'s Gaza workforce.\\nThe document says two joined Hamas terrorists in raiding an Israeli kibbutz and directly participated in violence, another two staffers kidnapped an Israeli woman, holding her hostage in their personal home; and, another UN staffer doled out ammunition to the Hamas terrorists.\\nAUSTRIA SUSPENDS PAYMENTS TO UNRWA AMID ISRAELI ALLEGATIONS UN WORKERS HELPED, CELEBRATED HAMAS\\nAn Israeli soldier patrols near Kibbutz Beeri in southern Israel on October 12, 2023, close to the place where 270 Israelis were killed by militants during the Supernova music festival on October 7.
